Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models JAX TPU implementation. Based on the network architecture in https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion , pretrained weights compatible.

Still quite WIP, though less so now, there is code for inference and basic training. Still quite slow and still needs some cleaning and testing, but the parts are all here.
